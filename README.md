## Final Project: Skill Gap AI Analyzer

## Project Overview
This project is developed as part of the **Infosys Springboard Program – Final Project**.  
The **Skill Gap AI Analyzer** is an intelligent system designed to analyze resumes and job descriptions to identify **matched skills, missing skills, and overall skill gaps**.

The project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and data analysis techniques to automate resume screening and provide meaningful insights through structured data and visual reports.
